# Face Mask Detection

## Description
This project implements a deep learning-based system to detect whether people are wearing face masks. The model classifies faces in images into two categories: **with mask** or **without mask**.  

The goal of this project is to provide a practical tool for monitoring mask usage, which can be useful in public places, workplaces, or educational environments. It demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques for real-time object detection and classification.

## Try the Live App
You can test the system interactively using the live Hugging Face app:
