# Face Mask Detection

This project is a deep learning model based on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** designed to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using images.  
It was developed as part of a machine learning training program at the National Telecommunication Institute (NTI).  
The goal is to automate face mask detection to support public health and safety efforts.

## Model
The model uses a CNN architecture to extract features from images and classify them into two categories:  
- With Mask  
- Without Mask
